## Data frame abstract data type

Programming languages used for processing data have typically developed the
notion of what is often called a _data frame_
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{definition}[data frame]
\vspace{0mm}
An abstract data type that represents data as a rectangular collection of
fields (or variable) and entries (or observations)
\end{definition}

\vspace{-2mm}
* A field is an ordered collection of homogeneous data typically with some
  semantic meaning.  E.g. age, weight, ...
* An entry is an ordered collection of heterogeneous data that are somehow
  associated.  E.g. a set of measurements obtained from performing a scientific
  experiment.
