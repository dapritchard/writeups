# Motivation

## Historical perspective

Metaprogramming

  * The S language bears a strong similarity to Scheme[^scheme] (with some
    notable exceptions).  <!-- paraphrased from Ihaka R A Language for Data
    Analysis and Graphics -->
  * One particular language feature that is fundamental to Lisp is a form of
    metaprogramming in which programs can create or manipulate other programs
    at runtime.  <!-- Scott page 562 -->

[^scheme]: A Lisp dialect created by Guy Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman.




## Historical perspective (cont.)

Metaprogramming

  * One form of metaprogramming that is available in many languages is the
    ability to `eval` text strings.
  * In Lisp there is no syntactical differentiation between code and data[^homoiconicity], so metaprogramming involves direct manipulating of the
    program.
  * S provides an interface to manipulate the data structure (more upcoming on
    this) that statements are stored in order to provide similar functionality.
    <!--

    -->

[^homoiconicity]: This property is often referred to as _homoiconicity_, however
there is some disagreement about the usage of the term, see
e.g. https://www.expressionsofchange.org/dont-say-homoiconic/.




## Abstract syntax trees

Statements in R and programming languages in general are naturally represented
by the interpreter as a tree-like data structure called an **abstract syntax
tree** (AST).

  * The read portion of the read-eval-print loop constructs the AST.
  * The R interpreter (in contrast to S) is implemented as a Lisp.
    * R's infix operators are translated to Polish notation (i.e. operators
      precede their arguments, and consequently is also known as prefix
      notation).
    * So, for example, `x + y` is translated internally to `"+"(x, y)`
    * Even structures like if-else if-else and for loops that are represented as
      syntax in many languages are mapped to prefix functions.




## Abstract syntax tree example

Consider the AST constructed from the expression `1 + 2 * 3`.  The AST has the
following form:

  * The result of evaluating `+` on `1` and
    * The result of evaluating `*` on `2` and `3`

The `lobstr::ast` function provides a visual representation of an AST
constructed from an R statement.

```{r}
library(lobstr)
ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```

<!-- You can construct a data structure representing an AST by using
e.g. `quote(1 + --> <!-- 2 * 3)` (more on this later). -->




## Abstract syntax tree components

There are four types of data structures that can be found in an AST, which are
collectively referred to as **expressions** by Wickham, Henry, etc.: <!--
Section 18.3, Advanced R -->

  * **Call**: A function call.
  * **Constant:** either `NULL` or a length-1 atomic vector.
  * **Symbol:** the name of an object like e.g. `x`.  (These are synonymously
    known in R as **name**s.)
  * **Pairlist**: a list-like object most often used to store a function's
    formal arguments.




## A note about terminology:

Hadley Wickham and Lionel Henry have co-opted the term _expression_ mean any of
the data structures found in an AST, however the R Language Definition does not
use this terminology.

  * The term _expression_ is used to mean any of the data structures found in an
    AST
  * R has an `expression` object, which Wickham and Henry refer to as
    _expression vectors_.
  * In general computer science literature, an expression is a combination of
    one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions that the
    programming language interprets.  The R Language definition refers to these
    as statements to disambiguate from expression vectors.

In this documents, we will follow the convention proposed by Wickham and Henry.




## Language objects

R has a primitive object type called language objects that are related to
expressions.

One of R's primative object types are called language objects.  These consist of
the following.

  * calls
  * symbols
  * expression vectors




## Expression vector examples

An expression vector is a list of R expressions.

```{r}
a <- expression(x + y, z)
b <- parse(text = "x + y; z")  # equivalent up to the attributes
is.expression(a)
is.expression(b)
a
b
```




## Evaluating expressions

You can use `eval` to evaluate an expression or expression vector.
```{r}
eval(parse(text = "x <- 2; x * x"))
eval(1)
eval(quote(mean(1L:11L)))
eval(quote(x))
```

It is interesting to note that in most languages, `eval` takes a string as
input.

  * Since the elements of the AST are exposed to the user, `eval` operates on
    them directly.




## Examples of common AST elements

```{r}
identical(quote(1), 1)  # by definition, constants are self-evaluating
is.language(1)

b <- quote(x)
is.language(b); is.symbol(b)

c <- quote(1 + 2 * 3)
is.language(c); is.call(c)
```




<!-- ## Language objects (cont.) -->

<!-- Some notes about language objects: -->

<!--   * Hadley Wickham and Lionel Henry use the term _expression_ to mean any of the -->
<!--     data structures found in an AST, and refer to the `expression` object as -->
<!--     _expression vectors_.  **We will follow suit.** -->
<!--   * Hadley suggests using lists of calls instead of expression vectors in most -->
<!--     cases. -->




## Manipulating calls

You can access and modify elements of a call using a list-like interface.

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
z <- quote(1 + 2 * 3)

z[[1L]]
is.symbol(z[[1L]])  # synonymous with `is.name`

z[[2L]]
is.numeric(z[[2L]])

z[[3L]]
is.call(z[[3L]])
```




## Manipulating calls (cont.)


```{r, collapse = TRUE}
z
ast(1 + 2 * 3)

length(z)
z[[1L]] <- as.name("-")  # synonymous with `as.symbol`
z[[2L]] <- quote(6 / 2)
z
```




## Example parsing input

```{r}
xdist = "x = rnorm(1,y,1)
y = rnorm(1,z,1)
z = rnorm(1,5,1)"
```




## `parse_heir_minilang` definition

```r
parse_hier_minilang <- function(hierarchical) {
  comb_hier <- function(outerdist, innerdist) {
    out <- paste(
      strsplit(outerdist[2L], innerdist[1L])[[1L]],
      collapse = innerdist[2L]
    )
    c(outerdist[[1L]], out)
  }
  distexpr <- strsplit(
    strsplit(hierarchical, "\n")[[1L]],
    " *= *"
  )
  distcomb <- Reduce(comb_hier, distexpr)
  distcomb[[2L]]
}
heir_dist_expr <- parse_hier_minilang(xdist)
n_sims <- replicate(1000L, eval(parse(text = heir_dist_expr)))
```




# Promises and lazy evaluation

## Lazy evaluation in R

The S language stipulates that the arguments of a function call are not
evaluated until they are needed.

  * A form of _lazy evaluation_.
  * Implemented in R by assigning each formal argument name a special object of
    type _promise_.




## Promises

The _promise_ type has the following characteristics.

  * Contains three elements:
    * The expression provided as input to the argument in the function call.
    * The environment (i.e. the scope) in which to evaluate the expression.
    * The value obtained by evaluating the expression (initially empty).
  * The value of the promise is calculated the first time it is needed, and not
    before.  After calculation the value is stored.
  * Subsequent uses of the variable use the stored value.




## Extracting the promise expression

The `substitute` function creates an expression in a manner similar to `quote`.

  * However, `substitute` performs the added step of replacing symbols that
    it finds in the expression that exist in the specified environment.
    * The environment is specified through the formal argument `env` (default is
      the current environment).
    * If a symbol in the expression has a binding in the specified environment,
      then it replaces the symbol with the value bound to the symbol in the
      environment.




## Extracting the promise expression (cont.)


```{r}
print_input <- function(x) {
  substitute(x)
}
print_input(1 + 2 * 3)
```
