* Doom keybindings

To see the full list of keybindings, as usual you can use =describe-mode= (=C h
m=).

It is worth noting that the usual outline commands such as =outline-promote= and
=outline-demote= (and found in the =g= prefix) are remapped to Org mode specific
commands.

- Prefix keys
  - =SPC m= prefixes Org-specific bindings.
  - =z= has additional commands.
  - =g= has outline movements such as =g j= and =g k=.
- Top-level bindings
  - =C-return= to add a header or item (context-sensitive) at the current level.
  - =M-return= to add a header at the current level.
  - =C-k= and =C-j= to move up/down the headers at the same level.
  - =M-h= and =M-l= to promote/demote headers or list elements.
  - =M-k= and =M-j= to move up/down headers or list elements.
  - =M-K= and =M-J= to move up/down a single header or list element.
  - =v a e= and =d a e= to select/delete an element.
  - =v a R= and =d a R= to select/delete a subtree.
  - =S-<left>= or =S-<right>= (i.e. shift left/right arrow) toggles to-do items.
    Alternatively, you can use the =SPC m t= prefix to add a to-do state.
